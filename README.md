# Java Backend Learning Projects

This repository contains backend practice work built with Java and Spring Boot.  
It includes the following folders:

1. **core-java** – Java fundamentals and practice exercises  
2. **rest-api-practice** – Practice building REST APIs with Spring Boot  
3. **springboot-basics** – Basic Spring Boot applications demonstrating CRUD and service layering

These helped me understand backend workflows, request handling, and MVC architecture.
